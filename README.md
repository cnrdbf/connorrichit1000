## Skills
I am very new to coding and programming so my current skills in the IT field are very limited and basic at the moment. I do have plenty of sales experience with my current job at TigerTech in the Mizzou Store. I work well under pressure and have good problem-solving skills, which is one of the reasons I choose this major.
